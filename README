GCTools is a PHP framework that is meant to enable developers to create
PHP applications quickly, and effectively. It is not like many of the
Content Management Systems (CMSes) that are out on the market today due
to the fact that we do not really store informating natively. We do, however
enable the developer to create a CMS using out framework.
